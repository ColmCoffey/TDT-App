# VRx Health: A VR Smartphone Application for Measuring Temporal Discrimination Threshold

## Introduction üìñ

TDT VR is a novel VR smartphone application designed to measure Temporal Discrimination Threshold (TDT) in clinical and research settings. This project aims to standardize TDT testing methodology and make it more accessible through the use of low-cost, commercially available VR headsets and smartphones. The app provides a user-friendly interface for conducting TDT tests across multiple sensory modalities, potentially advancing our understanding of movement disorders like Cervical Dystonia.

## Thesis Document üìÑ

This repository includes the master's thesis "The Development and Testing of a Low-Cost Virtual Reality Application for Testing Temporal Discrimination in Dystonia" by Colm Coffey. The thesis provides comprehensive background on TDT testing, details the development process of the TDT VR app, and presents initial validation results. It serves as both documentation for the project and a scientific foundation for future research using this tool.

Key sections of the thesis include:
- Literature review on TDT testing methodologies
- Development process of the TDT VR application
- Validation study comparing TDT VR to existing methods
- Discussion of potential clinical applications

For full details, please refer to the complete thesis document in the repository.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Visual TDT testing**: Fully implemented using VR headset together with an Android smartphone
- **Auditory TDT testing**: Under development (expected completion: Q4 2024)
- **Tactile TDT testing**: Under development using smartphone vibration (expected completion: Q2 2025)

- Multiple testing modes: 
  - Staircase
  - Random
  - Converge algorithms
 
- Customizable test parameters:
  - Number of trials
  - Catch trials
  - Stimulus duration
  - Inter-stimulus interval (ISI)
 
- Real-time monitoring of test progress
- Automatic data collection and result calculation
- Email report generation
